# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project detection of passenger sitting is done and temperature is incresed, This project is used in the colder areas where temperature is less and On and off of heater and setting of Temperature is possible if the passenger occupies the seat.
## Objectives
To detect the passenger sitting
To Enable Heater
To set the temperature
## Features
1.Changing temperature
2.Detect the passenger
3.Display the temperature
4.Enable the heater
## 4 W's and 1 H
### Who
Passenger who is sitting
### What
This provides user interface to change or set temperature
### When
Whenever person wants to use seat heater
### Why
This is usefull in the areas with less temperature
### How
Implemented using AVR microcontroller,sensors,interrpts,LEDs.
